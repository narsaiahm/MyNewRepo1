Most operations in Git only need local files and resources to operate – generally no information is needed from another computer on your network. If you’re used to a CVCS where most operations have that network latency overhead, this aspect of Git will make you think that the gods of speed have blessed Git with unworldly powers. 

Because you have the entire history of the project right there on your local disk, most operations seem almost instantaneous.

For example, to browse the history of the project, 

Git doesn’t need to go out to the server to get the history and display it for you – it simply reads it directly from your local database.

This means you see the project history almost instantly. 


If you want to see the changes introduced between the current version of a file and the file a month ago, 


Git can look up the file a month ago and do a local difference calculation, instead of having to either ask a remote server to do it or 

pull an older version of the file from the remote server to do it locally.
